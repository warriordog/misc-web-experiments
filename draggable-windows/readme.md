# Draggable Windows

Prototype (not production-ready) implementation of HTML windows.
Supports drag, resize, and scroll operations.
Windows are z-sorted and background windows are hidden from screen readers.
Windows can be created and closed at-will, with no practical limitation.

This implementation is based on WebComponents.
An [older, worse version](v1/windows.js) is also available.
